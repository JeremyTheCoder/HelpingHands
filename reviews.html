            clean for our military housing. She is very thorough and meticulous
            when it comes to cleaning your home. We were so thankful to Meaghan
            that we passed our home inspection with flying colors. She is very
            knowledgeable when it comes to Knox Hills requirements to pass the
            home Inspection. Without a doubt, she and her cleaning partner
            Stacey are the go to’s for cleaning services. My only wish was that
            I met you sooner...Meaghan. Wishing you ladies well In your new

            are truly helpful hands. I wanted to get my garage to a point that
            it could be useable space for a variety of activities. Meghan did a
            fantastic job at working with me and coaching me through the
            process. I highly recommended Helping Hands, their unique and
            customizable service, and their pure joy of doing what they love to
