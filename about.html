        <p class="bio">
          Stacey has been a military spouse for 16 years. She has been married
          for almost 17 years to her Elementary sweetheart, Uriah. They have
          three children. Her favorite part of being a military spouse is all
          the people she gets to meet and connect with. Stacey's first
          professional cleaning experience dates back to 2001 when she started
          cleaning local beach houses in her hometown in North Carolina. She is
          grateful to be back into the profession after so many years. For her,
          nothing compares to the gratification of helping others in her
          community. Knowing that her small contributions and attention to
          detail can make someones life a little more brighter means the world
          to her.
